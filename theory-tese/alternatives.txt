What I want my thesis to be about
1.
Thesis Objectives:
	1. Technical Threat Taxonomy problem:
		- Propose a comprehensive technical threat taxonomy (botnet, DDoS, portscan, L7protocol-bruteforce, etc.)
	2. Feature Choice problem:
		- Study every tool and dataset feature-sets
		- Build a comprehensive and organized feature-set based on the previously studied feature-sets
	3. Feature Relevance problem:
		- Use machine learning to find correlations between threat classes and communication-features
		- Study the best identifying features for each threat class (e.g.: botnet, DDoS, portscan) and/or specific threat (Mirai, 3ve, emotet, nmap, etc.). The focus will be botnets.
	4. Detection problem:
		- Test state-of-the-art tools (bro ids, suricata, ossim, maltrail, etc.) and analyse their results
		- Build a detection system based on the previously studied threat classes
		- Present our detection results and compare them to the state-of-the-art tools

Thesis Objectives:
	- Use Ntop features as a basis
	- Feed Bro IDS the relevant and try to detect botnet threats
	- If it doesn't work, try custom solution. Etc...
