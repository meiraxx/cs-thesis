## Threat Hunting Platform
**Implementation steps:**
- **[R] - Implement the possibility of data visualization**
- [I] - Implement Communication Mapping (with more info such as n_links created to each host, n_links accepted/dropped/rejected, etc.; each info allows for different visualization modes: Failure Mapping Mode, Service Mapping Mode, etc.; note: communication mapping shows every host that is engaged in network activities with any other host)
- [I] - Implement the possibility of data filtering
- [I] - Implement the possibility of data labelling
- **[R] - Implement user-made rule-based detection models**
- [I] - Implement suggestions for detection based on known threats
- [O] - Implement a testing platform for detection models (requires data labelling)
- [O] - Implement the possibility of feature backtracing (using an explainable AI system)
- [O] - Implement user-made AI-based detection modules

**Legend:**
- [R] - Required
- [I] - Important
- [O] - Optional
