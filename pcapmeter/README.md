## PCAP Meter
This project has the objective of extracting useful statistics from a PCAP file.

### What you can do with this tool
+ Create new datasets with your capture files (the community thanks you if you label and share them)
+ Analyze PCAP files manually: overview analysis, look for abnormal statistics
+ Use as a basis for a Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS) and Network Intrusion Prevention System (NIPS)

Give it good use :)
